## Project Overview
Developed a robust vehicle routing algorithm for solving the closed symmetrical TSP/VRP (optimising routes that start and end at the same point). It delivers near-optimal solutions at scales far beyond the capability of many existing methods.

In the end, an algorithm was produced that performed **exceptionally**, even beating some benchmarks found using exact methods by renowned organisations like Heidelberg University... a truly incredible result! 

## Deliverables
* **Introductory & Demonstrative Video**
* **Dissertation**
* **Codebase**
* **Invalid TSP Inputs**

The entire process, from ideation to evaluation, has been documented in the **dissertation** itself, which can be found in the 'dissertation' folder. The dissertation is beginner-friendly, and is intentionally designed to be understood not only by subject experts, but also by those who have minimal knowledge of the field. All while providing sufficient clarity and depth for everybody.

A 10 minute **video** has also been included. This video briefly runs through the project's background, demonstrates usage of the code, and discusses the overall results and future implications.
